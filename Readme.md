# Project Title

This project requires you to run two scripts in order: `createRandomDir` and `app`.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. Run the `createRandomDir` script. This script is responsible for setting up necessary directories for the application.

```bash
node Utils/createRandomDir.mjs
```

After the directories have been set up, run the app script. This script starts the application.

```bash
node `./app`
```

Ensure you follow the steps in the given order for the application to function correctly.

3. Optionally, you can run the `app` script with an argument to specify a directory. For example, to run the application with the `Shopping/` directory, use the following command:

```bash
node ./app.mjs Shopping/

```
